## Wisp Forest Documentation

This repository contains the markup for our documentation hosted over at https://docs.wispforest.io/. The [theme](https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs-theme) is also included as a submodule in case you want to serve the site locally.

### Cloning

If you only want to make small modifications that do no require actually building the site, clone like normal:

`git clone https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs`

Otherwise, you'll need the theme as well. For this, clone with submodules:

`git clone https://github.com/wisp-forest/docs --recursive`
